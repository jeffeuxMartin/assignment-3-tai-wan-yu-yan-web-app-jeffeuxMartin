## Option 1: Spacy Streamlit
It was deployed to https://jeffeuxmartin-spacy-streamlit-app-ncbl3p.streamlit.app/French and the pull request has been launched [here](https://github.com/howard-haowen/spacy-streamlit/pull/3).
The next step (if I have time) is to get all languages provided by spaCy completed and merge all classmates' work together. Then, add a more product-side version.

## Option 3: Sakiraya Wordle
This requires some linguistic background of the language. I just tried to use alphabet as basic graphemes (though I know it should probably be incorrect). Keyboard compatability and cross-lingual unification are next objectives.

Option 2 is not attempted because of the difficulty of corpus collection. I so far is not a linguist yet, but gathering Taiwanese languages (including especially their "speech data") is my pursuit. I hope my speech processing background helps here.

# More detailed discussion welcomed!

Feel free to contact me through jeffeuxmlta2020@gmail.com . I am very interested in merging these 3 apps and others into a huger project.
